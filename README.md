# Abstract
There have been several studies and contributions concerning the safety and security
of vehicles. Road accidents have emerged among the pronounced causes of death.
However, in recent years, an unconscious error from the driver’s bit has surfaced and
has been proven as a critical factor for causing road accidents. Drowsiness has causes
like sleep deprivation, tiring journey, and alcohol consumption. Drowsiness slows the
driver’s reaction time to be able to apply brakes or apply a sudden steer and influences
the driver’s judgment capability. In situations like these, an individual is not in com-
plete supervision of his own body. Once it is clear that the driver is not active, all the
solutions yield only one question, whether the driver has to be alerted or the vehicle
should be stopped or powered down. Since then, driver drowsiness and its reasons are
being investigated to provide a real-time, practical solution.There are several solutions
suggested that provide assistance that alerts the driver or takes control of the vehicle if
drowsiness is detected.

This project aims to consider facial features like the eye and the mouth and study these
facial features to predict using Open CV to know if the driver is conscious enough.
It proposes Deep Learning-based algorithms on the calculated eye closure and mouth
distances, yawns to detect drowsiness.
